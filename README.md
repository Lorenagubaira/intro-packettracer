Cisco‚Ñ¢ Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool developed by Cisco. It allows you to create complete virtual networks, with routers, switches, firewalls and other devices, and then run tests and simulations.

It is an ideal tool for learning about networks and cybersecurity, as it allows you to:

- Experiment safely: You can create attack scenarios without risk to real equipment or data.
- Visualize network traffic: See how data is sent and received on the network, which helps you better understand how protocols and vulnerabilities work.
- Practice troubleshooting: You can face different types of attacks and try different solutions to defend the network.
- Learn about different security technologies: You can implement firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and other security measures to protect the network.
In short, Packet Tracer is a powerful and versatile tool that allows you to learn about networking and cybersecurity in a practical and safe way.

## üîç How to install Packet Tracer

### To download Packet Tracer

1. Access the following [this link](https://www.netacad.com/portal/resources/packet-tracer).
2. You will need to create an account to log in, logging in with your Google account makes the process easier.
3. Locate the "Download" section.
4. Choose the version compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux).
5. Click on the download link and save the file to your computer.

### To install Packet Tracer

1. Run the installation file you downloaded.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Accept the license terms and conditions.
4. Choose the location where you want to install Packet Tracer.
5. Click "Install" to start the installation.
6. Once the installation is complete, you can start Packet Tracer.

## üíª Packet Tracer interface

This is the Packet Tracer window, let's identify the areas we are going to work on.

![Packet Tracer interface](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/pkt-interface.png?raw=true)

1. Device types: Here you can find organized by categories the different devices that you can represent in Packet Tracer, from network devices such as switches and routers, to IOT devices such as a smart fan.
2. Devices: Displays the devices that are in the category selected in the previous section. From here you can drag and drop them wherever you want in the Workspace.
3. Work area: This is where you will arrange the different devices and connect them to set up your network. In this course we will focus on the logical view, where you can build a graphical representation of your network and configure it. Packet Tracer also allows you to simulate physical spaces and connections between different spaces, but as mentioned, this is beyond the scope of this course.
4. Activity instructions: In this window you can see step-by-step instructions to perform the activity. You can go back and forth as you need to advance or review a previous step, and in real time you can see the percentage of completion of your activity. If you close the window, you can reopen it from the "Window" menu.
5. Connectivity tests: This list shows you the connection tests between devices in your simulation, with this you can check which device is connecting and which is not.
6. Toolbar: As in any application, this bar shows you with icons the most used options. With time you will be able to identify each icon, but by placing the cursor over it you can read the name of the function that executes the icon.
7. Menu bar: All the functions that are on the toolbar, and some that are not, you can locate in these menus.

## üìù Create your first network

[Download here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/intro-packettracer/raw/main/assets/Intro-packet-tracer.pka) the interactive guide that will guide you through the connection of your first network in Packet Tracer. With it you will learn the basics of this tool that will serve you for the rest of the course, where you will have to simulate scenarios for cybersecurity analysis.
